# Chrome Dev Summit site

The site is based on Google AppEngine, so you'll need the [SDK and launcher](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads).

Once you have that, you'll need to:

1. Install node.js.
1. Install npm and sass.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `grunt dev` during work and `grunt` to do a full build. (You can also do `grunt full` if you want to have images optimized via ImageOptim.)
